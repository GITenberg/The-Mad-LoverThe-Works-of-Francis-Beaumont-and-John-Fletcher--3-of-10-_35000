<p class="center"><i>Flourish. Enter </i>Astorax<i> King of </i>Paphos,<i> his Sister </i>Calis<i>,
Train, and </i>Cleanthe, Lucippe<i> Gentlewomen, at one
door; at the other </i>Eumenes<i> a Souldier.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Eume.</i> Health to my Soveraign.<br />
<br />
<i>King.</i> <i>Eumenes</i>, welcome:<br />
Welcome to <i>Paphos</i>, Souldier, to our love,<br />
And that fair health ye wish us, through the Camp<br />
May it disperse it self, and make all happy;<br />
How does the General, the valiant <i>Memnon</i>,<br />
And how his Wars, <i>Eumenes</i>?<br />
<br />
<i>Eume.</i> The Gods have giv'n you (Royal Sir) a Souldier,<br />
Better ne're sought a danger, more approv'd<br />
In way of War, more master of his fortunes,<br />
Expert in leading 'em; in doing valiant,<br />
In following all his deeds to Victories,<br />
And holding fortune certain there.<br />
<br />
<i>King.</i> O Souldier,<br />
Thou speak'st a man indeed; a <a name="p2_l19" id="p2_l19"></a>Generals General,<br />
A soul conceiv'd a Souldier.<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> Ten set Battels<br />
Against the strong usurper <i>Diocles</i><br />
(Whom long experience had begot a Leader,<br />
Ambition rais'd too mighty) hath your <i>Memnon</i><br />
Won, and won gloriously, distrest and shook him<br />
Even from the head of all his hopes to nothing:<br />
In three, he beat the Thunder-bolt his Brother,<br />
Forc'd him to wall himself up: there not safe,<br />
Shook him with warlike Engins like an Earthquake,<br />
Till like a Snail he left his shell and crawl'd<br />
By night and hideous darkness to destruction:<br />
Disarm'd for ever rising more: Twelve Castles,<br />
<a name="p2_l33" id="p2_l33"></a>Some thought impregnable; Towns twice as many;<br />
Countries that like the wind knew no command<br />
But savage wildness, hath this General<br />
With loss of blood and youth, through Storms and Tempests<br />
<a name="p2_l37" id="p2_l37"></a>Call'd to your fair obedience.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span><i>King.</i> O my Souldier<br />
That thou wert now within my arms; what drums   <span class="lbrace"><span class="ft20">{ </span></span> <span class="lalign1"><a name="p3_l1" id="p3_l1"></a><i>Drums</i><br /><i>within.</i></span><br />
Are those that beat <i>Eumenes</i>?<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> His, my Soveraign;<br />
Himself i'th' head of conquest drawing home,<br />
An old man now to offer up his glories,<br />
And endless conquest at your shrine.<br />
<br />
<i>King.</i> Goe all,<br />
And entertain him with all Ceremonie,<br />
We'l keep him now a Courtier.<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> Sir, a strange one,<br />
Pray God his language bear it; by my life, Sir<br />
He knows no complement, nor curious casting<br />
Of words into fit places e're he speak 'em,<br />
He can say fight well fellow, and I'le thank thee:<br />
He that must eat, <a name="p3_l15" id="p3_l15"></a>must fight; bring up the rear there,<br />
Or charge that wing of horse home.       <span class="ralign">[<i>Flourish.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>King.</i> Goe too, goe too.<br />
</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter </i>Memnon<i>, and a train of Courtiers, and
Souldiers, two Captains, </i>Chilax.</p>

<p>
Valiant and wise are twins Sir: welcom, welcom,<br />
Welcom my fortunate and famous General,<br />
High in thy Princes favour, as in fame,<br />
Welcom to Peace, and <i>Paphos</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> Thank your Grace,<br />
And would to God my dull tongue had that sweetness<br />
To thank you as I should; but pardon me,<br />
My sword and I speak roughly Sir: your battels<br />
I dare well say, I have fought well; for I bring ye<br />
That lazie end you wish for Peace, so fully,<br />
That no more name of war is: who now thinks<br />
Sooner or safer these might have been ended,<br />
Begin 'em <a name="p3_l32" id="p3_l32"></a>if he dare again; I'le thank him.<br />
Souldier and Souldiers Mate these twenty five years,<br />
At length your General, (as one whose merit<br />
Durst look upon no less,) I have waded through<br />
Dangers would <a name="p3_l36" id="p3_l36"></a>damp these soft souls, but to hear of.<br />
The maidenheads of thousand lives hang here Sir,<br />
Since which time Prince, I know no Court but Marshal,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>No oylie language, but the shock of Arms,<br />
No dalliance but with death; No lofty measures<br />
But weary and sad marches, cold and hunger,<br />
Larums at midnight Valours self would shake at,<br />
Yet I ne're shrunk: Balls of consuming Wildfire,<br />
That lickt men up like lightning, have I laught at,<br />
And tost 'em back again like childrens trifles.<br />
Upon the edges of my Enemies swords<br />
I have marcht like whirle-winds, fury at this hand waiting,<br />
Death at my right; Fortune my forlorn hope,<br />
When I have grapled with destruction,<br />
And tug'd with pale fac'd Ruine, Night and Mischief,<br />
Frighted to see a new day break in bloud;<br />
And every where I conquer'd; and for you Sir,<br />
Mothers have wanted wombs to make me famous,<br />
And blown ambition, dangers; Those that griev'd ye,<br />
I have taken order for i'th' earth: those fools<br />
That shall hereafter&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>King.</i> No more wars my Souldier:   <span class="lbrace"><span class="ft20">{ </span></span> <span class="lalign1"><i>K. takes </i>Mem.<i> aside</i><br /><i>and talks with him.</i></span><br />
We must now treat of peace Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Clean.</i> How he talks,<br />
How gloriously.<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> A goodly timber'd fellow,<br />
Valiant no doubt.<br />
<br />
<i>Cle.</i> If valour dwell in vaunting;<br />
In what a phrase he speaks, as if his actions<br />
Could be set off in nothing but a noise;<br />
Sure <a name="p4_l27" id="p4_l27"></a>h'as a drum in's mouth.<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> I wonder wenches<br />
How he would speak to us.<br />
<br />
<i>Clean.</i> Nothing but Larum,<br />
Tell us whose throat he cut, shew us his sword,<br />
And bless it for sure biting.<br />
<br />
<i>Lucippe.</i> And 't like your Grace,<br />
I do not think he knows us what we are,<br />
Or to what end; for I have heard his followers<br />
Affirm he never saw a woman that exceeded<br />
A Sutlers wife yet, or in execution<br />
Old bedrid Beldames without teeth or tongues,<br />
That would not flie his furie? how he looks.<br />
<br />
<i>Clea.</i> This way devoutly.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span><br />
<i>Cal.</i> Sure his Lordship's viewing<br />
Our Fortifications.<br />
<br />
<i>Lucip.</i> If he mount at me,<br />
I may chance choak his Battery.<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> Still his eye<br />
Keeps quarter this way: <i>Venus</i> grant his valour<br />
Be not in love.<br />
<br />
<i>Clean.</i> If he be, presently<br />
Expect a Herald and a Trumpet with ye<br />
To bid ye render; we two Perdu's pay for't else.<br />
<br />
<i>King.</i> I'le leave ye to my sister, and these Ladies<br />
To make your welcom fuller: my good souldier<br />
We must now turn your sternness into Courtship;<br />
When ye have done there, to your fair repose Sir: <span class="ralign">[<i>Flourish.</i></span><br />
I know you need it <i>Memnon</i>; welcom Gentlemen. <span class="ralign">[<i>Exit</i> King.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Luci.</i> Now he begins to march: Madam the Van's yours,<br />
Keep your ground sure; 'tis for your spurrs.<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> O <i>Venus</i>.   <span class="lbrace"><span class="ft30">{ </span></span> <span class="lalign"><i>He kneels amaz'd, and</i><br /><i>forgets to speak.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> How he stares on me.<br />

He will grow toth' ground else.<br />
<br />
<i>Eumenes.</i> Speak Sir, 'tis the Princess.<br />
<br />
<i>1 Cap.</i> Ye shame your self, speak to her.<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> Rise and speak Sir.<br />
Ye are welcome to the Court, to me, to all Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Lucip.</i> Is he not deaf?<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> The Gentleman's not well.<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> Fie noble General.<br />
<br />
<i>Lucip.</i> Give him fresh air, his colour goes, how do ye?<br />
The Princess will be glad Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> Peace, and hear me.<br />

<i>Cal.</i> I thank your Lordship heartily: proceed Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Lucip.</i> Lord how it stuck in's stomach like a surfeit.<br />
<br />
<i>Clean.</i> It breaks apace now from him, God be thanked,<br />
What a fine spoken man he is.<br />
<br />
<i>Lucip.</i> A choice one, of singular variety in carriage.<br />
<br />
<i>Clean.</i> Yes and I warrant you he knows his distance.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><br />
<i>Mem.</i> With all my heart I love thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> A hearty Gentleman,<br />
And I were e'en an arrant beast, my Lord,<br />
But I lov'd you again.<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> Good Lady kiss me.<br />
<br />
<i>Clean.</i> I marry, <i>Mars</i>, there thou cam'st close up to her.<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> Kiss you at first my Lord? 'tis no fair fashion,<br />
Our lips are like Rose buds, blown with mens breaths,<br />
They lose both sap and savour; there's my hand Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> Fie, fie, my Lord, this is too rude.<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> Unhand me,<br />
Consume me if I hurt her; good sweet Lady<br />
Let me but look upon thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> Doe.<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> Yet&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> Well Sir,<br />
Take your full view.<br />
<br />
<i>Lucip.</i> Bless your eyes Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> Mercy,<br />
Is this the man they talkt of for a Souldier,<br />
So absolute and Excellent: O the Gods,<br />
If I were given to that vanitie<br />
Of making sport with men for ignorance,<br />
What a most precious subject had I purchas'd!<br />
Speak for him Gentlemen: some one that knows,<br />
What the man ails; and can speak sense.<br />
<br />
<i>Clean.</i> Sure Madam,<br />
This fellow has been a rare Hare finder.<br />
See how his eyes are set.<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> Some one goe with me,<br />
I'le send him something for his head, poor Gentleman,<br />
He<a name="p6_l32" id="p6_l32"></a>'s troubled with the staggers.<br />
<br />
<i>Lucip.</i> Keep him dark,<br />
He will run March mad else, the fumes of Battels<br />
Ascend into his brains.<br />
<br />
<i>Clean.</i> Clap to his feet<br />
An old Drum head, to draw the thunder downward.<br />
<br />
<i>Cal.</i> Look to him Gentlemen: farewel, Lord I am sorry<br />
We cannot kiss at this time, but believe it<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>We'l find an hour for all: God keep my Children,<br />
From being such sweet Souldiers; Softly wenches,<br />
Lest we disturb his dream.      <span class="ralign">[<i>Exeunt</i> Calis <i>and</i> Ladies.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> Why this is Monstrous.<br />
<br />
<i>1 Capt.</i> A strange forgetfulness, yet still he holds it.<br />
<br />
<i>2 Capt.</i> Though he ne're saw a woman of great fashion<br />
Before this day, yet methinks 'tis possible<br />
He might imagine what they are, and what<br />
Belongs unto 'em: meer report of others.<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> Pish, his head had other whimsies in't: my Lord,<br />
Death I think y'are struck dumb; my good Lord General.<br />
<br />
<i>1 Capt.</i> Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> That I do love ye Madam; and so love ye<br />
An't like your grace.<br />
<br />
<i>2 Capt.</i> He has been studying this speech.<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> Who do ye speak to Sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> Why where's the Lady,<br />
The woman, the fair woman?<br />
<br />
<i>1 Capt.</i> Who?<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> The Princess,<br />
Give me the Princess.<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> Give ye counsel rather<br />
To use her like a Princess: Fy my Lord,<br />
How have you born your self, how nakedl[<a name="p7_l23" id="p7_l23"></a>y]<br />
Laid your soul open, and your ignorance<br />
To be a sport to all. Report and honour<br />
Drew her to doe you favours, and you bluntly,<br />
Without <a name="p7_l27" id="p7_l27"></a>considering what, or who she was,<br />
Neither collecting reason, nor distinction.<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> Why, what did I my Masters?<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> All that shews<br />
A man unhandsom, <a name="p7_l31" id="p7_l31"></a>undigested dough.<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> Did not I kneel unto her?<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> Dumb and sensless,<br />
As though ye had been cut out for your fathers tomb,<br />
Or stuck a land-mark; when she spoke unto you,<br />
Being the excellence of all our Island,<br />
Ye star'd upon her, as ye had seen a monster.<br />
<br />
<i><a name="p7_l38" id="p7_l38"></a>Me</i>[<i>m</i>]. Was I so foolish? I confess <i>Eumenes</i>,<br />
I never saw before so brave an outside,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>But did I kneel so long?<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> Till they laught at ye,<br />
And when you spoke I am asham'd to tell ye<br />
What 'twas my Lord; how far from order;<br />
Bless me, is't possible the wild noise <a name="p8_l4" id="p8_l4"></a>of war<br />
And what she only teaches should possess ye?<br />
Knowledge to treat with her, and full discretion<br />
Being at flood still in ye: and in peace,<br />
And manly conversation smooth and civil,<br />
Where gracefulness and glory twyn together,<br />
Thrust your self out an exile?<br />
Do you know Sir, what state she carries?<br />
What great obedience waits at <a name="p8_l12" id="p8_l12"></a>her beck continually?<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> She ne're commanded<br />
A hundred thousand men, as I have done,<br />
Nor ne're won battel; Say I would have kist her.<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> There was a dainty offer too, a rare one.<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i> Why, she is a woman, is she not?<br />
<br />
<i>Eumen.</i> She is so.<br />
<br />
<i>Mem.</i>  Why, very well; what was she made for then?<br />
Is she not young, and handsom, bred to breed?<br />
Do not men kiss fair women? if they doe,<br />
If lips be not unlawfull ware; Why a Princess<br />
Is got the same way that we get a begger<br />
Or I am cozen'd; and the self-same way<br />

<i>Ruins our selves, and damps the Writers care:</i><br />
<i>Would we knew what to doe, or say, or when</i><br />
<i>To find the mindes here equal with the men:</i><br />
<i>But we must venture; now to Sea we goe,</i><br />
<i>Faire fortune with us, give us room, and blow;</i><br />
<i>Remember ye're all venturers; and in this Play</i><br />
<i>How many twelve-peaces ye have 'stow'd this day:</i><br />
<i>Remember for return of your delight,</i><br />
<i>We launch, and plough through storms of fear, and spight:</i><br />
<i>Give us your fore-winds fairly, fill our wings,</i><br />
<i>And steer us right, and as the <a name="p75_l13" id="p75_l13"></a>Saylor sings,</i><br />

<p><i>Here lyes the doubt now, let our Playes be good,</i><br />

<i>Our preparations new, new our Attire,</i><br />
<i>Yet here we are becalmed still, still i' th' mire,</i><br />
<i>Here we stick fast; Is there no way to clear</i><br />
<i>This passage of your judgement, and our fear,</i><br />
<i>No mitigation of that law? Brave friends,</i><br />
<i>Consider we are yours, made for your ends,</i><br />
<i>And every thing preserves it self, each will</i><br />
<i>If not perverse, and crooked, <a name="p75_l28" id="p75_l28"></a>utter still</i><br />
<i>The best of that it ventures in: have care</i><br />
<i>Ev'n for your pleasures sake, of what we are,</i><br />
<i>And do not ruine all, You may frown still,</i><br />
<i><a name="p75_l32" id="p75_l32"></a>But 'tis the nobler way, to check the will.</i>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
